                Although born and raised in Silicon Valley, my coding journey took flight in a vibrant co-work space in Sofia, Bulgaria. Mesmerized by the dance of my friend's espresso-fueled fingers on the keyboard, accompanied by the tunes of Pink Floyd, I sensed a harmonious fusion of artistry and logic that left me captivated. It was in that revelatory moment that I yearned to expand my creative horizons and embarked on a new chapter, influenced by the innovative spirit that shaped my upbringing.
              </p>
              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                In 2022, fueled by eagerness to broaden my knowledge, I dove into online courses and sought guidance from mentors who helped me carve a path toward becoming a front-end web developer. My ultimate goal is to contribute my skills to a dynamic team, crafting modern web applications that leave a positive impact on lives, no matter how small.

              <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
                When not immersed in code, you'll find me strumming my guitar, playing classic rock, funk, and R&B. Nature beckons, and I prioritize regular hikes through the beautiful hills of the Bay Area. My spirit finds fulfillment in travel as well—I recently embraced new experiences during a six-month adventure living in Istanbul, Turkey.
              </p>

              <p>
                This journey weaves together coding, music, nature, and travel, as I explore self-discovery, creativity, and making a difference. The innovative energy of my Silicon Valley upbringing continues to shape my interests and fuel my drive. Join me as I continue to grow, learn, and leave my mark in this ever-changing world.

                    At the start, I wanted to keep things simple, so I started with just displaying the title on each card. But as I got more comfortable with the project, I pushed myself to add more features. One of the things I came up with was a character countdown in the message body, which was a fun addition.

                    <br>
                    Another aspect I worked on was implementing sorting capabilities. Now, users can sort their entries by date or alphabetically, making it easier to organize and find specific items.

                    This was my first professional project. It provided me with invaluable experience in leveraging a company's branding assets to create a responsive ad that aligned with their marketing objectives. The implementation of Google Ads alongside the landing page resulted in a substantial surge in lead generation for the company.

Conversion increased by 100% from the previous landing page. Because of the innovative design element of capturing emails before prompting the appointment schedule, we captured and re-engaged potential clients who would have abandoned the process without us knowing about them."

                    At the start of this project, I realized my JavaScript logic skills were limited. To level up, my mentor suggested building a vanilla JS calculator. I felt overwhelmed initially, but I decided to start with a simple HTML and CSS design to get things moving.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Step by step, I faced and conquered challenges along the way. One of my early wins was figuring out how to display numbers on the calculator's screen. It may seem small, but it was a significant milestone for me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After completing the calculator in vanilla JS, I didn't stop there. I refactored it into React to improve functionality and maintainability. This decision paid off, giving me a deeper understanding of React's power.

                    Initially, I thought creating a Tic Tac Toe app would be straightforward after completing a React Calculator. However, I was mistaken. The complexity increased when I decided to implement a computer player. During the project, I had a breakthrough in working with reducers, simplifying functions, and utilizing booleans as state toggles. It was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my problem-solving skills and provided insights into state management. I'm proud of the progress made and the lessons learned.

                    Through this project, I realized the power of leveraging packages as efficient tools to reach solutions rather than reinventing the wheel. Navigating extensive package documentation was challenging, but I found a streamlined solution with minimal dependencies, making troubleshooting easier and enabling a focus on core functionality. This experience emphasized the value of selecting appropriate tools, exploring documentation thoroughly, and embracing simplicity and efficiency in development.

                    During this project, I experienced a significant breakthrough in my understanding of state management. One of the challenges I faced was implementing a countdown clock, which required some creative problem-solving. Once I overcame that obstacle, the project progressed smoothly. As an additional self-imposed challenge, I incorporated a feature where the UI of the timer would dynamically toggle colors based on whether the user was in a 'session' or 'break' mode.
